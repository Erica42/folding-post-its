### Folding Post-its

This is a quick app to step through learning how to fold origami using post-its.
Post-its have a sticky part which makes them harder to fold, so the folds might be a bit different from what people are used to.

This was a project to create a whole app from nothing.

I had to create this new repo rather than forking it because I didn't understand Heroku. I know better now. #showyourwork
